## How to run it locally 
- Clone the repo using git clone https://github.com/chiragj97/Dtrons.
- npm install - to install all the required dependencies.
- Now hit *npm start* command and it will initiate the json-server and the react start script. The app will be visible with the data from the local database, i.e. from the json file created locally and making it work like a mongodb collection using json-server.
